# Car Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes car dataset(s) to extract insights related to pricing, specifications, and other attributes. The goal is to clean, visualize, and interpret the data using Python and relevant libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of Key Metrics
- Statistical Insights
- Machine Learning (optional)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset contains car attributes such as price, mileage, brand, model, year, and fuel type.
- Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate folder before running the analysis.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Car_Dataset_Analysis_Project.ipynb`).
- Run the cells step by step to see data transformations and insights.
- Modify the parameters as needed for deeper analysis.
