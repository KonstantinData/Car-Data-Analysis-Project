# 🚗 Car Dataset Analysis Project

## 📖 About the Project
The **Car Dataset Analysis Project** focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset about cars. The goal of 
this project is to clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about 
the automotive market. Through this process, various aspects of data analysis, feature engineering, and 
visualization techniques are applied. This project demonstrates the power of data-driven insights for 
understanding complex datasets.

## 📋 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed information about cars, including technical specifications, performance 
metrics, and market attributes. Below is a summary of the dataset's features:

- **Make**: Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford).
- **Model**: Model name of the car.
- **Year**: Year the car was manufactured.
- **Engine Fuel Type**: Type of fuel the car uses (e.g., gas, diesel, hybrid, electric).
- **Engine HP**: Horsepower of the engine.
- **Engine Cylinders**: Number of cylinders in the engine.
- **Transmission Type**: Type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
- **Driven_Wheels**: Drivetrain type (e.g., front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).
- **Number of Doors**: Number of doors on the car (e.g., 2, 4).
- **Market Category**: The segment or market class of the car (e.g., SUV, sedan, luxury).
- **Vehicle Size**: Size category of the car (compact, mid-size, large).
- **Vehicle Style**: Style of the car (e.g., coupe, convertible, hatchback).
- **highway MPG**: Fuel efficiency on highways (miles per gallon).
- **city mpg**: Fuel efficiency in cities (miles per gallon).
- **Popularity**: A numerical representation of the car's popularity.
- **MSRP**: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.

## 🛠️ Objectives of the Analysis
The analysis focuses on the following key areas:

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Address missing values and standardize data.
- Ensure all columns have appropriate data types for analysis.
- Filter the dataset to include cars manufactured in 1995 or later.
- Standardize text data in specific columns.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features for deeper insights:
  - **Total MPG**: Calculate the average of `city mpg` and `highway MPG`.
  - **Price per HP**: Derive the price-to-performance ratio by dividing `MSRP` by `Engine HP`.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Group Analysis**: Analyze data by categories like drivetrain, vehicle size, and engine cylinders.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Distribution of fuel efficiency.
  - Pricing trends by vehicle size.
  - Relationship between engine horsepower and price.
  - Price differences by drivetrain.
  - MPG trends by transmission type.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Study relationships between variables like price, popularity, horsepower, and fuel efficiency.

## 📊 Key Deliverables
The project produces the following outcomes:

- **Cleaned Dataset**: A refined dataset with missing data addressed, proper data types, and filters applied.
- **New Features**: Columns such as `Total MPG` and `Price per HP` for deeper analysis.
- **Visual Insights**:
  - Trends in pricing (`MSRP`) and market size (`Vehicle Size`).
  - Relationships between engine performance (`Engine HP`) and price.
  - Analysis of price variations across drivetrain types (`Driven_Wheels`).
  - Changes in fuel efficiency (city and highway) by transmission type.
- **Summary Report**: A concise summary of insights and patterns identified from the dataset.
